## Project Description
This project is created as part of Assignment 1 for the IT3040 – ITPM module.  
The objective of this assignment is to evaluate the accuracy and usability of a real-world web application that converts **Singlish input into Sinhala output**.

The system under test:
https://www.swifttranslator.com/

Automated functional and UI-related test scenarios have been implemented using **Playwright**.


## Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Playwright
- TypeScript
- Git & GitHub

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or above recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Running the Tests


npx playwright show-report


## Test Coverage

The automated test cases cover:

* Positive and negative functional scenarios
* Different sentence structures (simple, compound, complex)
